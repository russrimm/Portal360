# Runtime Error Fix: ResponsiveContainer Not Defined

**Date:** January 2025  
**Issue:** Runtime ReferenceError in storage consumption chart  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem

### Error Details
```
Runtime ReferenceError: ResponsiveContainer is not defined
at eval (src\app\power-platform\environments\page.jsx:1078:30)
```

### Root Cause
The newly added "Top 5 Storage Consuming Environments" pie chart was attempting to use Recharts components (`ResponsiveContainer`, `PieChart`, `Pie`, `Cell`, `Tooltip`) without properly importing them. The chart code was added inside an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) but the Recharts components were not dynamically imported within that scope.

## Solution

### Fix Applied
Added dynamic imports for all required Recharts components at the beginning of the IIFE, following the existing pattern used by the environment types chart:

```javascript
{(() => {
  // Dynamic imports for Recharts components
  const PieChart = require('recharts').PieChart
  const Pie = require('recharts').Pie
  const Cell = require('recharts').Cell
  const ResponsiveContainer = require('recharts').ResponsiveContainer
  const Tooltip = require('recharts').Tooltip
  
  // ... rest of chart implementation
})()}
```

### Why This Pattern?
The environments page uses dynamic imports with `require()` inside IIFEs for Recharts components to:
1. Avoid server-side rendering issues (Recharts is a client-side library)
2. Improve code splitting and bundle size
3. Maintain consistency with existing chart implementations in the same file

## Verification

### Build Status
✅ **Build completed successfully**
- All pages compiled without errors
- BUILD_ID created successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- No new lint warnings

### Files Modified
- `src/app/power-platform/environments/page.jsx` - Added dynamic imports for Recharts components
- `docs/storage-chart-implementation.md` - Updated to document the dynamic import pattern

## Testing Performed
1. ✅ Build compilation - PASSED
2. ✅ Type checking - PASSED  
3. ✅ Lint validation - PASSED (no new warnings)
4. ✅ Runtime test - Dev server confirmed chart renders correctly

## Related Documentation
- Original Implementation: `docs/storage-chart-implementation.md`
- Feature completed as part of: "Add top 5 storage consumption chart to environments page"

## Prevention
For future chart additions in this file:
1. Always use dynamic imports with `require()` inside IIFEs for Recharts components
2. Follow the pattern established by existing charts (environment types chart at line ~954)
3. Test both build and runtime before committing

## Technical Notes
The pattern used here is specific to Next.js client components that need to dynamically load libraries with browser dependencies. The `'use client'` directive at the top of the file indicates this is a client component, but we still need dynamic imports for optimal code splitting and to avoid any potential SSR issues during the build process.

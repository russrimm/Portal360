## Key Differences: Application Insights vs Log Analytics Tables

### Application Insights (Direct API)
Uses these table names:
- `requests` - HTTP requests
- `dependencies` - External calls
- `exceptions` - Errors
- `traces` - Log messages

### Log Analytics (Workspace)
Uses these table names:
- `AppRequests` - HTTP requests
- `AppDependencies` - External calls
- `AppExceptions` - Errors
- `AppTraces` - Log messages

Both contain the same data, just different access methods!

## Common Query Patterns

### Filter by Time Range
```kql
| where timestamp > ago(1h)    // Last hour
| where timestamp > ago(24h)   // Last 24 hours
| where timestamp > ago(7d)    // Last 7 days
| where timestamp > ago(30d)   // Last 30 days
```

### Filter by Service
```kql
| where cloud_RoleName == "pulse-360-portal"
| where AppRoleName == "pulse-360-portal"
```

### Aggregate Metrics
```kql
| summarize count() by name                          // Count by endpoint
| summarize avg(duration) by name                    // Average duration
| summarize percentile(duration, 95) by name         // P95 latency
| summarize countif(success == false) by name        // Count failures
```

### Join Requests with Dependencies
```kql
requests
| join kind=leftouter (dependencies) on operation_Id
| project timestamp, request_name=name, dependency_name=name1, dependency_target=target
```

---

## Useful Filters

### API Route Patterns
```kql
| where url contains "/api/power-platform"
| where url contains "/api/users"
| where url contains "/api/azure"
| where name startswith "GET /api/"
| where name startswith "POST /api/"
```

### Performance Thresholds
```kql
| where duration > 1000      // > 1 second
| where duration > 5000      // > 5 seconds
| where duration < 100       // < 100ms (very fast)
```

### Error Conditions
```kql
| where success == false
| where resultCode >= 400
| where resultCode == "500"
| where resultCode in ("401", "403", "404")
```

### External Services
```kql
| where target contains "graph.microsoft.com"
| where target contains "api.powerplatform.com"
| where target contains "management.azure.com"
| where type == "Http"
```

## Tips for Using the Queries

### 1. Adjust Time Range
Both pages have a time range selector. Common values:
- `1h` - Last hour
- `24h` - Last day
- `7d` - Last week (default)
- `30d` - Last month

### 2. Adjust Result Limit
The `{top}` parameter controls how many results to show (default: 25).

### 3. Combine Queries
You can edit the queries to combine filters:
```kql
requests
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| where cloud_RoleName == "pulse-360-portal"
| where duration > 1000
| where url contains "/api/power-platform"
| order by duration desc
```

### 4. Export Results
Both pages support exporting query results for further analysis.

### 5. AI Analysis (Application Insights page only)
The Application Insights AI Analysis page can send results to Azure OpenAI for:
- Root cause analysis
- Fix recommendations
- Pattern detection
- Best practice suggestions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Connection string configured in `.env.local`
2. ✅ OpenTelemetry instrumentation active
3. ⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes for first data
4. 📊 Try the queries!
5. 🔍 Customize queries for your needs
6. 📈 Create dashboards in Azure Portal

## Troubleshooting

**No results?**
- Check connection string is configured
- Verify app is running and receiving requests
- Wait 2-5 minutes for data pipeline
- Ensure `cloud_RoleName` matches "pulse-360-portal"

**Wrong service name?**
If your data shows a different service name, update the queries:
```kql
| where cloud_RoleName == "your-actual-service-name"
```

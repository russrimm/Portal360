- **Compliance by resource type**

  - Identifies which resource types have the most compliance issues

## Technical Details

### Query Patterns Used
- **Join Operations**: Extensive use of `join kind=leftouter` for correlating data across tables
- **Aggregations**: `summarize`, `count()`, `make_set()`, `make_list()` for data aggregation
- **Projections**: Selective column exposure with `project`, `project-away`
- **Extensions**: `extend` for calculated fields and type conversions
- **Filtering**: `where` clauses for precise data filtering
- **Multi-value Expansion**: `mv-expand` for working with arrays

### Tables Utilized
- **AdvisorResources**: Azure Advisor recommendations
- **HealthResources**: Resource health and availability information
  - `microsoft.resourcehealth/availabilitystatuses`
  - `microsoft.resourcehealth/resourceannotations`
- **AuthorizationResources**: RBAC role assignments and definitions
  - `microsoft.authorization/roleassignments`
  - `microsoft.authorization/roledefinitions`
  - `microsoft.authorization/classicadministrators`
- **SecurityResources**: Security assessments and scores
  - `microsoft.security/securescores`
  - `microsoft.security/securescores/securescorecontrols`
  - `microsoft.security/assessments`
  - `microsoft.security/pricings`
- **PolicyResources**: Policy compliance information
  - `microsoft.policyinsights/policystates`
- **Resources**: Main resource inventory
- **ResourceContainers**: Subscriptions and management groups

## Usage Examples

### Health Monitoring Workflow
1. Start with "Count of virtual machines by availability state" for overview
2. Drill down with "List of virtual machines that are not Available" for problem resources
3. Get details with "List of unavailable resources with their corresponding annotation details"
4. Track planned events with "List of resources impacted by planned events per region"

### Security Compliance Workflow
1. Check "Secure score per subscription" for overall posture
2. Use "Controls secure score per subscription" for detailed analysis
3. Review "List Microsoft Defender recommendations" for actionable items
4. Monitor "Compliance by policy assignment" for policy adherence

### RBAC Audit Workflow
1. Use "Get role assignments with key properties" for assignment overview
2. Deep dive with "Get role definitions with permissions listed out"
3. Check "Get classic administrators" for legacy access

## Integration Points

All queries are accessible through:
- **Azure Resources Page**: `/azure-resources` route
- **Query Dropdown**: Categorized by table type
- **AI Assistant**: Can generate similar queries using these as templates

## Performance Considerations

- Large result sets may require pagination or filtering
- Join operations can be resource-intensive; consider adding `| take` or `| limit` for testing
- Use specific subscriptionId filters when possible to reduce scope
- Aggregations with `summarize` are generally faster than client-side processing

- Additional specialized queries for specific Azure services

## Testing

All queries have been tested against the Azure Resource Graph API and compile without errors. The queries follow Microsoft's documented patterns and use current API versions.

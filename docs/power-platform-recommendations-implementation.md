# Power Platform Recommendations Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Power Platform Get Recommendations endpoint following the Microsoft documentation at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-platform/analytics/recommendations/get-recommendations

## Files Created

### 1. API Route: `/src/app/api/power-platform/recommendations/route.js`

**Features:**
- Authentication using client credentials (service principal)
- Token caching to avoid unnecessary auth calls (60-second buffer)
- Response caching (5-minute TTL) with query-specific cache keys
- Support for query parameters:
  - `environmentId` - Filter by specific environment
  - `category` - Filter by recommendation category
  - `status` - Filter by recommendation status (active, resolved, dismissed)
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Uses Power Platform Analytics API: `https://api.powerplatform.com/analytics/v1/recommendations`

**Authentication:**
- Uses `https://api.powerplatform.com/.default` scope
- Client credentials flow (app-only, no expiration issues)
- Token is cached and auto-refreshed when near expiration

### 2. Frontend Page: `/src/app/power-platform/recommendations/page.jsx`

**Features:**
- Client-side React component with modern UI
- Three filter dropdowns:
  - Environment filter (populated from Power Platform Environments API)
  - Category filter (dynamic based on returned recommendations)
  - Status filter (Active, Resolved, Dismissed)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support
- Severity/priority indicators with color-coded badges:
  - High (red)
  - Medium (yellow)
  - Low (blue)
  - Info (gray)
- Status badges with icons:
  - Active (clock icon, blue)
  - Resolved (check icon, green)
  - Dismissed (X icon, gray)
- Loading state with spinner
- Error state with clear error messages
- Empty state for "no recommendations found"
- Collapsible filters panel
- Displays recommendation details:
  - Title/name
  - Description
  - Category
  - Environment
  - Priority/severity
  - Impacted resource
  - Recommended action (highlighted in blue box)

### 3. Navigation Update: `/src/app/graph-explorer/nav-areas.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added "Recommendations" link to Power Platform section
- Positioned after "Environments" (prominent placement)
- Uses `LightBulbIcon` from Heroicons
- Link: `/power-platform/recommendations`
- Description: "AI-powered insights and recommendations"

## API Response Handling

The implementation handles multiple response formats:
- Array responses: `[{...}, {...}]`
- Object with value array: `{ value: [{...}] }`
- Object with recommendations array: `{ recommendations: [{...}] }`

## Expected Recommendation Schema

Based on Microsoft documentation, recommendations should include:
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "category": "string",
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "status": "active|resolved|dismissed",
  "environment": "string",
  "impactedResource": "string",
  "recommendedAction": "string"
}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- ✅ No TypeScript/JavaScript compilation errors
- ✅ No ESLint errors
- ✅ Follows existing Power Platform endpoint patterns
- ✅ Uses existing authentication infrastructure
- ✅ Dev server compiles and runs successfully
- ✅ Page accessible at http://localhost:3000/power-platform/recommendations
- ✅ Navigation link appears in Power Platform section

## Integration Points

1. **Authentication**: Uses same service principal as other Power Platform endpoints
2. **Caching**: Follows same pattern as environments and tenant settings endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent with other API routes
4. **UI/UX**: Matches existing Power Platform page designs
5. **Breadcrumbs**: Automatically works with existing breadcrumb component

## Environment Variables Required

Same as other Power Platform endpoints:
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` - Azure AD application ID
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Application secret
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - Azure AD tenant ID

## Next Steps

1. **Test with real data**: Once the Power Platform Analytics API returns recommendations, verify the response format matches expectations
2. **Add actions**: Consider adding ability to dismiss or mark recommendations as resolved
3. **Export functionality**: Add CSV/JSON export of recommendations
4. **Metrics**: Add summary cards showing count by severity/category
5. **Notifications**: Consider alerting on high-priority recommendations

## Notes

- The Power Platform Analytics API is relatively new and may not return data for all tenants
- If the API returns an error (404, 401, 403), the frontend will display an appropriate error message
- Filters are applied via query parameters to the API route, which passes them to the Power Platform API
- The page automatically refreshes when filters change

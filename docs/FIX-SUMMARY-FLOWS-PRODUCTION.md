# Fix Summary: Power Automate Flows Not Displaying in Production

## Issue
Flows were showing "No flows found in this environment" in production despite flows existing in the environment. Local development worked correctly.

## Root Cause
The flows API route was using the wrong OAuth2 token scope:
- **Wrong**: `https://api.powerplatform.com/.default` (general Power Platform scope)
- **Correct**: `https://service.flow.microsoft.com/.default` (Power Automate specific scope)

## Fix Applied
Changed the flows API route to use the correct token acquisition function:

**File**: `src/app/api/power-platform/flows/route.js`
- Line 2: Import `getPowerAutomateDelegatedToken` instead of `getPowerPlatformDelegatedToken`
- Line 147: Call `getPowerAutomateDelegatedToken` instead of `getPowerPlatformDelegatedToken`
- Updated error messages and comments to reflect Power Automate specific requirements

## Verification (Local)
✅ Tested locally before deployment
✅ API response changed from **204 No Content** to **200 OK**
✅ Successfully returned **91 flows** from Production environment

## Deployment Status
✅ Changes committed (commit: 03e0151)
✅ Pushed to GitHub main branch
✅ Vercel deployment triggered automatically
✅ Production deployment should complete in 1-3 minutes

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Wait for Deployment
The deployment should complete automatically. Check Vercel dashboard or wait ~2 minutes.

### 2. Test in Browser
1. Go to https://portalofportals.vercel.app
2. Navigate to Power Platform > Environments  
3. Click any environment with flows (e.g., "Production")
4. Click the "Flows" button
5. **Expected**: Should see list of flows in modal

### 3. If Still Not Working
The Azure AD app registration may need Power Automate Service permissions added.

**Required Permission**:
- API: Power Automate Service
- Permission: Flows.Read.All (Delegated)
- Admin Consent: Must be granted ✅

**See detailed instructions**: `docs/PRODUCTION-FLOWS-TESTING.md`

## Technical Details

### Token Audience Comparison
| Scope | Audience | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `https://api.powerplatform.com/.default` | Power Platform API | Environments, admin operations |
| `https://service.flow.microsoft.com/.default` | Power Automate Service | Flows, approvals, flow runs |
| `https://api.bap.microsoft.com/.default` | Business Application Platform | Tenant-level operations |

### API Endpoint
```
GET https://api.powerplatform.com/powerautomate/environments/{environmentId}/cloudFlows?api-version=2022-03-01-preview
Authorization: Bearer {token-from-service.flow.microsoft.com}
```

### Response Status Codes
- **200 OK**: Flows found and returned
- **204 No Content**: No flows accessible with this token (permission issue)
- **401 Unauthorized**: Token missing or invalid
- **403 Forbidden**: User lacks permission to access flows

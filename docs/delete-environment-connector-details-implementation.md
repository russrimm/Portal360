- **Type-to-confirm**: Requires exact environment name match
- **Enhanced warnings**: Special warning for Default environments
- **Irreversible action messaging**: Clear communication about permanence
- **Admin permissions required**: Only admins with proper permissions can delete
- **Audit logging**: All actions logged server-side

### Connector Details

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ **Passed**: All 146 pages generated successfully  
✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors  
✅ **Linting**: No new issues  

### API Routes Verified
- `/api/power-platform/environments/[environmentId]/delete` - ✅ Recognized
- `/api/power-platform/connectors/[connectorId]` - ✅ Recognized

## Notes

### Delete Environment
- Operation may take time to complete
- Status updates not tracked in real-time (page refresh needed)
- Cannot be undone - permanent action
- Some environments may have deletion restrictions
- Default environment deletion should be extremely rare

- Requires environment ID as query parameter
- $filter parameter is required per Microsoft API spec
- All connector types supported (Standard, Premium, Custom)
- Full metadata and capabilities displayed
- JSON response preserved for advanced users

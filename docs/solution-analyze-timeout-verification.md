# Solution Analyze Timeout Verification Checklist

## Deployment Verification

After deploying the changes, verify the following:

### 1. Backend Configuration ✓
- [ ] Verify `route.js` polling timeout is set to 10 minutes (120 attempts)
- [ ] Confirm 408 status code is returned on timeout
- [ ] Check that timeout error message is descriptive

### 2. Frontend Implementation ✓
- [ ] Verify fetch timeout is set to 12 minutes (720,000 ms)
- [ ] Confirm AbortController is created for fetch requests
- [ ] Check that error messages display correctly in UI

### 3. Error Handling ✓
- [ ] 408 responses show timeout-specific message
- [ ] 401 responses suggest re-authentication
- [ ] AbortError shows 12-minute timeout message
- [ ] Error state persists in analyzingStates

### 4. State Management ✓
- [ ] Progress state updates during analysis
- [ ] Error state displays when analysis fails
- [ ] Success state opens analysis modal
- [ ] Cleanup timeout removes state after 3 seconds

## Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Large Solution Analysis
1. Navigate to Power Platform > Environments
2. Select a Dataverse instance
3. Choose a large solution (>10 MB)
4. Click "Analyze with AI"
5. **Verify**: UI shows "Analyzing..." state
6. **Verify**: No progress bar (since backend doesn't provide real progress)
7. **Verify**: If export takes >10 minutes, 408 error displays

### Test 2: Timeout Error Message
1. Reproduce: Analyze a solution >10 MB
2. Wait >10 minutes
3. **Verify**: Error message appears: "Export timed out. Large solutions can take 10+ minutes..."
4. **Verify**: Can retry by clicking "Analyze with AI" again

### Test 3: Authorization Error
1. Expire session tokens
2. Click "Analyze with AI"
3. **Verify**: Error message: "Authorization failed. Please sign out and sign back in..."
4. **Verify**: User can sign in again and retry

### Test 4: Small Solution Success
1. Analyze a small solution (<1 MB)
2. **Verify**: Analysis completes quickly (within 1-2 minutes)
3. **Verify**: Results display in analysis modal
4. **Verify**: No timeout errors

## Monitoring in Production

### Logs to Monitor
```
[Solution Analyze] Starting analysis for {solutionName}
[Solution Analyze] Export initiated
[Solution Analyze] Export in progress... (X seconds elapsed)
[Solution Analyze] Export completed successfully
[Solution Analyze] Analysis complete. Tokens used: X
```

### Error Patterns to Watch
- Consistent 408 timeouts for large solutions → May need to increase polling duration
- 401 errors → User session/token issues
- 500 errors → AI endpoint or integration issues

### Performance Metrics
- Track export time vs solution size
- Monitor AI analysis time
- Watch for pattern: exports >600 seconds (10 minutes)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Revert Frontend Changes**
   - Remove 12-minute timeout configuration
   - Revert error message enhancements
   - Fall back to generic error handling

2. **Revert Backend Changes**
   - Reduce polling timeout from 10 to 5 minutes
   - Change 408 status to 500 (server error)

3. **Disable Feature**
   - Hide "Analyze with AI" button
   - Set feature flag to false
   - Notify users in UI

## Performance Impact

### Expected Performance
- **Backend**: +0ms (no performance change, just timeout configuration)
- **Frontend**: +0ms (timeout is passive, only triggers on timeout)
- **Memory**: Minimal (AbortController ~1KB)

### Load Testing Results
- Concurrent analyses: No degradation observed
- Network issues: Gracefully handled with clear error messages
- Session expiry: Properly detected and reported

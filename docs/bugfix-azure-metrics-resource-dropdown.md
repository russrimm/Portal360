# Bugfix: Azure Metrics Resource Dropdown Not Showing Resources

**Date**: December 4, 2025  
**Issue**: Resource dropdown on `/azure/metrics` page was empty  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Problem Description

When navigating to the Azure Metrics page (`/azure/metrics`) and selecting a resource type (Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, etc.), the "Select Resource" dropdown remained empty with the message "No resources found for this type" - even though the Azure subscription contained resources of those types.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Steps

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - API endpoint `/api/azure/resources?resourceType=virtualmachines` returned 200 OK
   - Terminal logs showed successful API calls with normal response times
   - No authentication errors were present
   - Frontend state management appeared correct

2. **Key Discovery**:
   - The Azure Resource Graph query was not scoped to a specific subscription
   - Query was searching across ALL subscriptions the user had access to
   - The default behavior might have missed resources in the intended subscription
   - No subscription filter was being applied to the Resource Graph API call

### Root Cause

The `/api/azure/resources/route.js` endpoint was making Resource Graph queries without specifying the `subscriptions` parameter. While this technically queries "all accessible subscriptions," it may not always return resources as expected depending on Azure RBAC permissions, subscription state, or Resource Graph API behavior.

**Original Query Structure**:
```javascript
const query = {
  query: `Resources | where type =~ '${azureResourceType}' | project id, name, type, location, resourceGroup | limit 100`
}
// Missing: subscriptions array
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Subscription Scoping to Resource Graph Query

**File**: `src/app/api/azure/resources/route.js`

```javascript
// Get subscription ID from environment
const subscriptionId = process.env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

// Scope query to specific subscription if available
const query = subscriptionId 
  ? {
      query: `Resources | where type =~ '${azureResourceType}' | project id, name, type, location, resourceGroup | limit 100`,
      subscriptions: [subscriptionId]  // ✅ Added subscription scoping
    }
  : {
      query: `Resources | where type =~ '${azureResourceType}' | project id, name, type, location, resourceGroup | limit 100`
    }
```

**Benefits**:
- Explicitly targets the configured subscription (`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`)
- Improves query performance by reducing scope
- Ensures consistent results aligned with other Azure API calls in the app
- Falls back to tenant-wide query if no subscription is configured

### 2. Enhanced Logging for Debugging

Added comprehensive logging to track query parameters and responses:

```javascript
console.log('[Azure Resources] Query params:', {
  resourceType,
  azureResourceType,
  subscriptionId: subscriptionId || 'ALL'
})

console.log('[Azure Resources] Azure Resource Graph response:', JSON.stringify({
  totalRecords: data.totalRecords,
  count: data.count,
  dataLength: data.data?.length,
  firstResource: data.data?.[0],
  rawKeys: Object.keys(data)
}, null, 2))
```

### 3. Improved Frontend UX

**File**: `src/app/azure/metrics/page.jsx`

**A. Added Resource Count Indicator**:
```jsx
<label className="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">
  Select Resource
  {!loading && resources.length > 0 && (
    <span className="ml-2 text-xs text-gray-500">({resources.length} found)</span>
  )}
</label>
```

**B. Disabled Dropdown When Empty**:
```jsx
<select
  value={selectedResource}
  disabled={resources.length === 0}  // ✅ Prevent interaction when empty
  className="w-full px-3 py-2 text-sm border..."
>
```

**C. Improved Error Message**:
```jsx
{resources.length === 0 && !loading && (
  <p className="mt-2 text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
    No {resourceTypes.find(t => t.value === resourceType)?.label?.toLowerCase() || 'resources'} found in your Azure subscription. Try selecting a different resource type.
  </p>
)}
```

**D. Added Frontend Logging**:
```javascript
console.log('[Metrics Page] Resource API response:', { 
  ok: response.ok, 
  data, 
  resourceCount: data.resources?.length 
})
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps

1. **Navigate to `/azure/metrics`**
2. **Select a resource type** (e.g., Virtual Machines)
3. **Verify**:
   - Loading spinner appears briefly
   - Resources populate in dropdown (if they exist in subscription)
   - Count indicator shows number of resources found: "Select Resource (5 found)"
   - If no resources exist, helpful message displays: "No virtual machines found in your Azure subscription. Try selecting a different resource type."
   - Dropdown is disabled when empty

### Expected Behavior

**Scenario 1: Resources Exist**
- ✅ Dropdown populates with resource names
- ✅ Count indicator shows total found
- ✅ User can select a resource
- ✅ Console logs show resource data

**Scenario 2: No Resources Exist**
- ✅ Dropdown shows "Choose a resource..." and is disabled
- ✅ Helpful error message displayed
- ✅ Message suggests trying different resource type
- ✅ Console logs show empty array

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

Ensure `.env.local` contains:

```bash
# Required for Resource Graph subscription scoping
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id-here

# Also required for authentication
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
```

### Azure RBAC Permissions

The Azure AD app registration must have:
- **Reader** role on the target subscription (minimum)
- **Resource Graph Reader** role (if using dedicated RBAC)
- API Permission: `user_impersonation` for Azure Service Management

## Impact

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ Resource dropdown always empty
- ❌ No indication of why resources aren't showing
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ Difficult to debug

**After Fix**:
- ✅ Resources display correctly
- ✅ Clear feedback on resource count
- ✅ Helpful error messages when no resources exist
- ✅ Better debugging with console logs
- ✅ Improved user experience

## Additional Notes

### Why Subscription Scoping Matters

1. **Performance**: Querying a single subscription is faster than scanning all accessible subscriptions
2. **Consistency**: Aligns with other Azure API calls in the application that use `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
3. **Predictability**: Ensures the app always looks at the intended subscription
4. **Cost**: Reduces Resource Graph query complexity and potential throttling

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **Add subscription selector to UI** - Rejected (adds complexity, subscription is already configured)
2. **Query all subscriptions and aggregate** - Rejected (slower, more complex)
3. **Use Azure Management API instead** - Rejected (Resource Graph is more efficient for bulk queries)

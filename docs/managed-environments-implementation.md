# Managed Environments Implementation

## Overview
Added ability to enable and disable managed governance for Power Platform environments directly from the Environments page.

## Implementation Date
January 2025

## Features Added

### API Routes
Created two new API endpoints following Microsoft Power Platform API specifications:

1. **Enable Managed Environment**
   - Path: `/api/power-platform/environments/[environmentId]/enable-managed`
   - Method: POST
   - Endpoint: `https://api.powerplatform.com/governance/environments/{environmentId}/enable-managed-environment?api-version=2022-03-01-preview`
   - Returns: OperationExecutionResult with status tracking

2. **Disable Managed Environment**
   - Path: `/api/power-platform/environments/[environmentId]/disable-managed`
   - Method: POST
   - Endpoint: `https://api.powerplatform.com/governance/environments/{environmentId}/disable-managed-environment?api-version=2022-03-01-preview`
   - Returns: OperationExecutionResult with status tracking

### UI Components
Enhanced the Governance & Protection tab on the Environments page with:

- **Managed Environment Status Card**
  - Shows current status (enabled/disabled)
  - Lists governance features provided:
    - Sharing limits for apps and flows
    - Usage insights and analytics
    - Data loss prevention policies
    - Maker welcome content

- **Enable/Disable Buttons**
  - Conditional rendering based on current managed status
  - Loading states with spinner animation
  - Confirmation dialogs with feature descriptions
  - Error display inline
  - Success notifications with page refresh

### Authentication & Authorization
- Uses delegated Power Platform tokens via OBO flow
- Requires appropriate admin permissions in Power Platform
- Token scope: `https://api.powerplatform.com/.default`

### Error Handling
- Network error catching
- API error response handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Inline error display in UI
- Console logging for debugging

### Data Refresh
- Automatic SWR revalidation after successful operations
- Page refresh notification to user
- Loading states tracked per environment

## Files Modified

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/power-platform/environments/[environmentId]/enable-managed/route.js` (new)
- `src/app/api/power-platform/environments/[environmentId]/disable-managed/route.js` (new)

### UI Components
- `src/app/power-platform/environments/page.jsx`
  - Added `managedEnvOps` state for tracking operations
  - Added `handleEnableManagedEnvironment` function
  - Added `handleDisableManagedEnvironment` function
  - Enhanced Governance & Protection section with control card

## Microsoft Documentation References
- Enable: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-platform/governance/environments/enable-managed-environment
- Disable: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-platform/governance/environments/disable-managed-environment

## Usage
1. Navigate to Power Platform → Environments
2. Expand any environment
3. Click the "Governance & Protection" tab
4. Use the "Enable Managed" or "Disable Managed" button based on current status
5. Confirm the action in the dialog
6. Wait for operation to complete
7. Page will refresh automatically with updated status

## Testing
- Build verified: ✅ All 146 pages generated successfully
- TypeScript checks: ✅ Passed
- Lint checks: ✅ Passed

## Notes
- Operations are asynchronous and may take time to complete
- Status returned is typically "Queued" initially
- Manual refresh may be needed to see final status
- Only environments with appropriate permissions can be modified
- Default environment may have restrictions
